* As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
* As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
* As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
* As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
* As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
* As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie

### Technologies used to build the project

### Planning, Development, and Problem-solving strategy
1. Planning - I started the process reading through the [project assignment respository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/java-interapt-11-8/Project-1), to try to clarify what the scope and expected deliverables were.
